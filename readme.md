git-hub(1)
=======================================

## SYNOPSIS

  `git hub [--force-origin] <contributors | issues | open | pull-request | stargazers | wiki>`

## DESCRIPTION

  Extension to control your Github repo from the command-line.
  Works with public Github.com or github:enterprise repos.

## RATIONALE

  I love git and Github. I love the shell/terminal. After doing
  ["focussed"][git-process] work in a topic branch, I want to type
  `git hub open` or `git hub pull-request` or `git hub issues` and be
  taken to the expected location on the Github website.

  This extension does not require Ruby and does not require you to
  provide username, password, or API key.

## COMMANDS

  `contributors`

  Visit your contributors list. Nothing wrong with a little commit vanity.

  `issues`

  Quickly navigate to the issue tracker.

  `open`

  open the github repo page in your default web browser (also the default if you do not specify a command).

  `pages`

  open the github pages url in your default web browser.

  `pull-request`

  Start a new pull request from the currently active (*) branch.

  `stargazers`

  Navigate to your stargazers list.

  `wiki`

  Go to the wiki.

## OPTIONS

  `--force-origin`

  force the use of `origin` rather than `upstream`.
